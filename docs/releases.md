# Releases

Run `make release` to:
- update [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md) using [conventional changelog](https://github.com/marcocesarato/php-conventional-changelog)
- commit the changes generated by the conventional changelog library
- tag the latest commit
- push the commit and the tag

## Prerequisites

1. We need to install [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) library in the terminal `sudo apt-get install jq`
2. We need to use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format in commit messages.
